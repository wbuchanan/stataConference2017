# 2017 Stata North American Users Group Conference
Slide deck for my talk at the conference __Stata extensibility with the Java API: Tools, examples, and advice__.

## Abstract
The inclusion of the Java API for Stata provides users, and user programmers, with exciting opportunities to leverage a wide array of existing work in the context of their Stata workflow. This talk will introduce a few tools designed to help others wanting to integrate Java libraries into their workflow, the Stata Maven Archetype, and the StataJavaUtilities library. In addition to a higher-level overview, the presentation will also show examples of using existing Java libraries to expand statistical models in psychometrics and send yourself emails when your job is complete, of phonetic string encodings and string distances, of accessing file/operating system properties, and examples to use as starting points for developing Java plugins in Stata.
